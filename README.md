## Current project goals:

- parse chrome bookmarks to obtain list of youtube channels (Yes, it is more logical to parse YT subscriptions, but in my case I've un-subscribed from a lot, leaving them in bookmarks. Because YT doesn't respect subscription folders much)
- having videoId - get various channel statistics:
   per-channel:  views count, likes. Qty of subscribers.
   per-video:    views count, likes

- compare and analyze statistics. Some kind of sort.

- move to web? (django, i suppose)
