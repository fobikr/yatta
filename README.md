# yatta

## Current project goals:

- ~~parse chrome bookmarks to obtain list of youtube channels (Yes, it is more logical to parse YT subscriptions, but in my case I've un-subscribed from a lot, leaving them in bookmarks. Because YT doesn't respect subscription folders much)~~
- ~~having videoId - get various channel statistics:~~
   - ~~per-channel:  views count, likes. Qty of subscribers.~~
   - ~~per-video:    views count, likes~~

- [in progress] integrate Django
       
       currently only 1 of 4 created functions run from web
- put all gathered data into DB
- deploy minimum viable product to pythonanywhere.com
- compare and analyze statistics for different YT users. Add some kind of sorting (e.g. by popularity).
