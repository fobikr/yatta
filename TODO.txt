TODO:
Get rid of maxresults=50 limit in get_video_attrs()
To do that i probably need to use Oauth2.
And i need "youtube" object, created with some YT library,
something like this:
youtube = build(YOUTUBE_API_SERVICE_NAME, YOUTUBE_API_VERSION,
                http=credentials.authorize(httplib2.Http()))
Example code could be found here:
https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/playlistItems/list
This it to get to youtube.playlistItems().list_next() method
